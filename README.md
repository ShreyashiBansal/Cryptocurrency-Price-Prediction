## What is Cryptocurrency ?
A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a binary data designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.
Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.


## What Is Ethereum?
* Ethereum is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency, called Ether (ETH) or Ethereum, and its own programming language, called Solidity.

* As a blockchain network, Ethereum is a decentralized public ledger for verifying and recording transactions. The network's users can create, publish, monetize, and use applications on the platform, and use its Ether cryptocurrency as payment. Insiders call the decentralized applications on the network "dapps."

* Ethereum is an open-source blockchain-based platform used to create and share business, financial services, and entertainment applications.
Ethereum users pay fees to use dapps. The fees are called "gas" because they vary depending on the amount of computational power required.
Ethereum has its own associated cryptocurrency, Ether or ETH.
bIts cryptocurrency is now second only to Bitcoin in market value.


## What Is Ethereum in Simple Terms?
* Ethereum, like any blockchain, is a database of information that is designed to be unhackable. Ether, or ETH, is the cryptocurrency used to complete transactions on the blockchain.

* Unlike in a traditional database, information in a blockchain is organized as a chronological "chain" made up of "blocks" of data. For instance, every transaction using an Ether coin must be verified and recorded as an additional block on that coin's unique blockchain.


# Libraries Used
### 1) Numpy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

### 2) Pandas
Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays.

### 3) Python Matplotlib
matplotlib.pyplot is a plotting library used for 2D graphics in python programming language. It can be used in python scripts, shell, web application servers and other graphical user interface toolkits.

### 4) seaborn
Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures.

* Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data. Its plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots. Its dataset-oriented, declarative API lets you focus on what the different elements of your plots mean, rather than on the details of how to draw them.

### 5) scikit-learn
Scikit-learn provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface in Python.

## Linear regression
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on â€“ the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.
